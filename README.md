# Scriptable Object Graph
A (soon to be) easily expandable implementation of Unity's experiemental GraphView system, built specifically for Scriptable Objects. 

Setting up the GraphView every time seemed like a chore, so I decided to make a package that would enable me to simple inherit from a few classes/interfaces and have a brand new node-based system without having to touch the GraphView code.

## How-to
**Proper documentation will be provided upon initial release!**
